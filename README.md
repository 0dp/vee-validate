# Vue-Validation

This is a lightweight plugin for [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) that allows you to validate input fields, and display errors.

**What makes it different is:** You don't have to do anything fancy in your app, most of the work goes into the html, You only need to specify for each input what kind of validators should be used when the value changes. You will then get informed of the errors for each field.

Although most of the validations occur automatically, you can use the validator however you see fit. The validator object has no dependencies and is a standalone object. This plugin is built with localization in mind. and currently there are over 20 validation rules available in the plugin.

Read the [documentation and demos](https://logaretm.github.io/vue-validation/).

This plugin is inspired by [PHP Framework Laravel's validation](https://laravel.com/).
